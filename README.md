# Storage for Source Data Files for Thinkful Projects

This repository has the source data files for projects in the Thinkful Data Science Flex course. The course uses Jupyter notebooks in Google Colaboratory, but there is an authentication issue that occurs when loading data files stored on Google Drive. Therefore, it is easier to read the data from GitHub.
